WHAT DATAFLUSH IS

DataFlush is a tool that allows you to move your data from a source to a destination.
Sources and destinations could be:
- a database
- a csv file
- a fixed width file

So you can use DataFlush for:
- extracting data from a database to a file
- importing data into a database from a file
- moving data from one database to another
- trasforming data files

DataFlush was not thought to be a full-featured, heavy load ready ETL tool but as a light and easy to use app that is able to automate the daily work of developers and DBAs.

DataFlush is completely written in Java so you can use it with any OS.
